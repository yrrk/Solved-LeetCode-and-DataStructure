#Animal Shelter: An animal shleter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out basis".
#People must adopt either the "oldest" of all animals at the shelter,
#or they can select whether they prefer a dog or a cat(and will receive oldest animal of that type)
#they cannot select which specific animal they would like.
#create the datastructre to maintain this system and implement operation such as enqueue, dequeueAny, deQueueDog, and DequeueCat.
#You may use the built-in linkedlist datastructre
